        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="text-primary">Project Details </span>We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

        Mockups/designs of any UI components

        Data models / API specifications of the core functionality

        An overview of the technology stack to be used

        Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

        PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

        What your project is not or will not provide or implement

        This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious.

        <span className="text-primary">Ecosystem Fit </span>Help us locate your project in the Rise Above Platform / Rise Ecosystem(s) / Rise Above Community Hubs.

        Landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

        Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

        Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

        What need(s) does your project meet?

        Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Rise Above Platform / Rise Ecosystem(s) / Rise Above Community Hubs.

        If so, how is your project different?

        If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

        <span className="text-primary">Development Roadmap üî©</span>
        <br />
        This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories here. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

        Below we provide an example roadmap. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Rise Above Platform / Rise Ecosystem(s) / Rise Above Community Hubs.

        We recommend that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ‚âà 1 month.

        For each milestone, make sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.

        include the amount of funding requested per milestone.

        include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.

        Provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.

        Commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.

        Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

        ‚ö° If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish under the terms of the license of the respective project and that you highlight this fact in your milestone documentation and in the source code if applicable!

        Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.

        <br />
        <br />

        <span className="text-primary">Total Estimated Duration: </span>
        <br />
        Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months) Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see Wikipedia, e.g. 2 FTE)

        <br />
        <br />

        <span className="text-primary">Total Costs: </span>
        <br />
        Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the level of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in REVD, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
